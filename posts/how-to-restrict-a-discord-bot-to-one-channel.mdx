# How to Restrict A Discord Bot to One Channel, A Step-by-Step Guide

In 2021, Discord introducted a new feature called [slash commands](https://discord.com/blog/slash-commands-are-here). Before that commands were text based in public channels using a prefix (aka a word or symbol before the actual command. Many bots, for example **mee6**, used !help as a prefix, which made it difficult for users when multiple bots used the same prefix). With slash commands, you can now use commands in any channel, even in DMs. This is great for bot developers, but not so great for server owners and discord mods.

Before the introduction of slash commands, restricting the text commands to a specific channel required denying the 'View Channel' permission to bots across all channels except the intended one. Slash commands are not affected by this permission, so you can't restrict a bot to one channel by denying the 'View Channel' permission anymore.

To limit a bot to a singular channel, follow these steps.

1. Navigate to the 'Integrations' tab in your server settings

2. Click 'Manage' next to the bot you want to restrict

3. Change slash commands permissions

4. Deny the 'Use Slash Commands' permission for all channels

5. Add channels

6. Use toggles to change which channels allow commands


If you followed these steps correctly, your bot will only be able to use slash commands in the channels you selected. If you want to allow a bot to use slash commands in all channels again, simply toggle the channel again.

Thats it for this guide. Make sure you add [some discord bots](https://wouldyoubot.gg/blog/10-best-discord-bots-for-any-server) to your server to make it more fun and useful.
